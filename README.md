Description : 

In this case our stakeholder is an app developer who needs data driven insights to decide what kind of app to build and they are seeking answers 
to questions like 'what app categories are most popular ?' ,'what price should i set' ,'how can i maximise user rating'.

Next we have done Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the Characteristics of the data structure and often reveals issues in the dataset 
thet needs to be addressed before further analysis.These issues include missing data  ,inconsistent data outliers so indentifying these issues 
early can save us a lot of time and effort in later stage of the analysis.

Next I have analyzed the data fully to gain some interesting insights.

Insights : 

1.Paid apps have better ratings
2.Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings
3.Finance and book apps have lower ratings
4.Apps with longer description have better ratings
5.A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5
6.Games and entertainment genre have so many apps so entering these spaces might be challenging
